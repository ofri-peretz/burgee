/**
 * Lock — measuring a cell's padding is linear in the cell.
 *
 * Upstream measured it with an unanchored trailing `\s*$` match and a leading one. The
 * trailing form is quadratic: the engine retries at every start position, and each attempt
 * walks the remaining whitespace before failing on the character that is not the end.
 * CodeQL raised it as alert 35, "polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data",
 * once `stripAnsi` came from linegauge and the string counted as library input.
 *
 * **The alert named the wrong character.** It says "strings with many repetitions of
 * '\t'", and a tab never reaches the regex at length: `shouldApplyLayoutDSL` routes any
 * string containing a tab or a newline into `applyLayoutDSL`, which splits on '\t' first,
 * so `measurePadding` sees 50,000 one-character columns and finishes in 11 ms. A space is
 * not in that test. It goes straight to `colFromString`, which hands the whole string over.
 * Measured here on `' '.repeat(50_000) + 'x'` through `div()`: **1,346 ms before the fix,
 * 0.2 ms after.** A finding that is real for a reason its own report gets wrong is worth
 * writing down, because the next reader checks the reported input, sees 11 ms, and closes
 * it.
 *
 * Only `div()` is timed. `toString()` on such a cell costs ~1,900 ms either way — that is
 * the wrapping path, it predates this change, and folding it in would make the budget
 * measure something the fix does not control.
 *
 * 250 ms is deliberately loose: 5x under the unfixed cost and a thousand times over the
 * fixed one, so a slow runner does not turn this red while a reintroduced backtracking
 * regex still does.

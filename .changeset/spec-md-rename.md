Stage 2's artifact is now `spec.md`, the name Anthropic's AI-Native SDLC playbook gives it, so the source comments and README sections that cite a package's own design document point at `spec.md` rather than `design.md`.

No behaviour changes. The published tarballs do move, by two bytes per surviving reference — `design.md` is nine characters and `spec.md` is seven — so the four packages carrying a weight band were re-measured against it: linegauge 83,538 to 83,536; paratext 66,343 to 66,341; closeout 84,455 to 84,453; bellpull 86,113 to 86,107.

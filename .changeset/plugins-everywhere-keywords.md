Every package now lists `plugin`, `plugins` and `extensible` in its npm keywords, because every package takes plugins through one shared contract.

A plugin is a plain object, validated against the `schema.json` that ships in every package, and checked with the package's own `check` command. Each package reads its own key and ignores the rest, so one object can extend any subset of the family. The [plugins page](https://github.com/ofri-peretz/burgee/blob/main/apps/docs/content/docs/plugins.mdx) has a nine-layer example that every package's `check` accepts in CI.
